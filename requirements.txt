#
# Installation:
# You can typically install these dependencies using pip:
# pip install -r requirements.txt
# or individually:
# pip install numpy Pillow spandrel pandas matplotlib
#
# Notes:
# - This list excludes standard Python libraries (e.g., os, math, json).
# - This list excludes packages assumed to be installed by ComfyUI itself
#   (e.g., torch, torchvision, torchaudio) or internal ComfyUI modules.
