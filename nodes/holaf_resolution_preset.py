# Purpose:
# This file defines the 'HolafResolutionPreset' custom node for ComfyUI.
# Its goal is to simplify setting optimal image dimensions (width, height)
# for image generation workflows, particularly when targeting specific
# Stable Diffusion models (SD1.5, SDXL, FLUX) which have recommended
# native resolutions for best performance.
#
# Design Choices & Rationale:
# - Combined Approach: Instead of just selecting a model or a ratio, the node
#   combines both. The user selects a standard aspect ratio (e.g., "16:9 Landscape")
#   and a target model type (e.g., "SDXL").
# - Optimal Resolution Matching: The node then finds the predefined, recommended
#   resolution for the selected model that most closely matches the chosen
#   aspect ratio *and* its orientation (portrait/landscape/square).
# - Avoiding Suboptimal Scaling: This prevents simply scaling a base resolution
#   (like 1024x1024) to fit a ratio, which might result in dimensions not ideal
#   for the model's training.
# - Predefined Data: Uses hardcoded lists (`SD15_RESOLUTIONS`, `SDXL_RESOLUTIONS`,
#   `FLUX_RESOLUTIONS`) containing tuples of (width, height, pre-calculated_ratio)
#   for known good dimensions for each model type. FLUX resolutions are specifically
#   calculated to meet its unique constraints while matching standard ratios.
# - User-Friendly Ratios: Employs a dictionary (`ASPECT_RATIOS`) mapping common,
#   human-readable ratio names (including orientation) to their numerical values. Includes "Random".
# - Matching Logic:
#   1. Determines the target aspect ratio: from optional input image if `use_image_ratio` is True,
#      otherwise from the dropdown (handling "Random" selection).
#   2. Retrieves the list of resolutions for the selected model.
#   3. Determines the target orientation (portrait/square/landscape) based on the target ratio.
#   4. Filters the model's resolutions to only include those matching the target orientation.
#   5. Tries to find a predefined resolution with an *exact* ratio match (within tolerance).
#   6. If an exact match is found, it's returned.
#   7. If no exact match, it *calculates* a new resolution:
#      a. Starts with the largest dimension found in the predefined list for that model.
#      b. Calculates the other dimension to match the target aspect ratio.
#      c. Scales the dimensions proportionally to fit within a target megapixel range
#         specific to the model (e.g., 1-1.5MP for SDXL).
#      d. Rounds the final dimensions to the nearest multiple required by the model
#         (e.g., multiple of 8 for SDXL/FLUX, 64 for SD1.5), ensuring a minimum size.
# - Fallback: Includes a basic fallback mechanism if no resolutions match the
#   target orientation *before* calculation (returns the first resolution listed for the model).
# - Optional Image Input: Allows providing an image to derive the target aspect ratio
#   instead of using the dropdown, controlled by a boolean toggle (`use_image_ratio`).
# - Cache Busting (`IS_CHANGED`): Forces re-execution when "Random" is selected or when
#   `use_image_ratio` is True and the input image might have changed (based on shape).
